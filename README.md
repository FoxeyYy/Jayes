# What is Jayes?

Jayes is a Bayesian Network Library for Java. It has initially been created as my bachelor's thesis
and it's goal is to provide highly efficient Bayesian Networks algorithms to the open souce community.
In fact, there are already good Bayesian Networks libraries available, but they are either closed-source,
GPL-licensed or rather inefficient. For certain projects, these aspects hinder the usage of such libraries.
This is why Jayes was created.

# Who uses Jayes?

Jayes was first created to serve as a component of the [Code Recommenders Project](http://www.eclipse.org/recommenders/) at Eclipse.
There it is used to predict method calls invoked by the developer.
I would love to know when other people use it and how :-) 

Features:
- exact inference of marginals in Bayesian Networks
- support of XMLBIF
